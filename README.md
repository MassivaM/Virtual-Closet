# Virtual-Closet

This retro virtual closet is inspired by the outfit styler from the movie Clueless and helps me build a more sustainable closet âœ¨âœ¨ <br /> <br />
It allows me to select the type of outfit I'm looking to create , select a top and bottom and randomize outfits<br /> <br />
Once a selection is made the data is sent to a Notion database that keeps tracks of the amount of wears of every piece has and my favorite pairings <br /><br />

### Sustainable materials and stores are marked with a ðŸŒ± so that they can be chosen for future purchases
